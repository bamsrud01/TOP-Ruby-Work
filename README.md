### 01. Caesar Cipher

  The Caesar Cipher is an encryption technique named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his correspondence.  It is a very simple cipher, where each letter in the original text is replaced by another letter that occurs a specific number of positions down the alphabet.  For example, given the text "Hello" and a number of 2, the encrypted text would read "Jgnnq".  If encrypted letters exceed Z, they loop back to the beginning.

### 02. Stock Picker

  This file accepts an array representing stock prices, one per day.  Given these prices, the file will return two days: The day to buy and the day to sell.  By following these guidelines, the user's profit will be maximized.
